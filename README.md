# 🗂 CRUD Operations

I have created CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations with the help of React and Tailwind CSS. I have stored the data in the local storage of the browser. All these operations applied by me are on the same storage. 
## 👨‍💻 Tech Used 

**Tool(s):** VS Code, Git, Chrome Browser

**Programming Language(s):** React, Tailwind CSS
